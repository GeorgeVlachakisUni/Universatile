# Uni-Versatile

It is a consept Student Information System (SIS) that started as a project for our "Team Project" module in the Computing class of our University of Derby studies. This fork is maintained and worked on by me after our assignment reached its deadline and was submitted, with the aim of impoving my coding skills and becoming familiar with .NET.
